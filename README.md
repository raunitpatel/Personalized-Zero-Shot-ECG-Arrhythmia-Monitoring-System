
# Personalized Zero-Shot ECG Arrhythmia Monitoring System

## üìñ Overview

This project implements a **Personalized Zero-Shot ECG Arrhythmia Monitoring System** that leverages domain adaptation techniques to classify and monitor arrhythmias in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. It focuses on personalized monitoring by adapting models to individual users' data, enabling effective detection of suspicious heartbeats with minimal labeled data. The system is built using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, with a modular structure for data preparation, model training, and inference.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Zero-Shot Learning**: Enables arrhythmia detection with limited or no labeled data for new users.
- **Domain Adaptation**: Adapts models to individual users for personalized performance.
- **Ensemble Classification**: Combines multiple classifiers for robust predictions.
- **Energy-Efficient Detection**: Optimized for computational efficiency during real-time monitoring.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Includes data preprocessing, model training, validation, and inference.
